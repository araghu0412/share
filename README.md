# 📈 Personal Stock Investment Tracker

A full-stack personal stock investment tracker designed to streamline investment analysis and decisions. This project evolved from a spreadsheet-based workflow into a fully interactive application with visual insights and real-time data handling.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

I’m an active stock investor, and this project was born from a personal need: tracking and analyzing stock investments beyond spreadsheets. I initially maintained all my purchase/sell data in Excel to monitor performance, assess diversification across sectors and market caps, and separate short-term from long-term investments.

This application eliminates the manual work involved in spreadsheet updates and enables instant visual analysis through a user-friendly UI backed by a Spring Boot-powered backend.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

This app replaces a tedious, error-prone Excel-based investment tracker with a dynamic UI that lets me:
- Quickly analyze sector diversification
- Compare investments across market caps
- Separate short-term vs long-term decisions
- Make data-driven decisions on whether to **buy more**, **hold**, or **sell**

It also gave me hands-on experience with both Vue.js and Angular frontends tied to a common backend, strengthening my full-stack development expertise.
